## 1. Introduction to igraph and Basics 

Welcome to the igraph tutorial! 
Don't worry if you are not familiar with the igraph package yet. We will start from the begining taking it step by step so you will be confident in no time.  

We will explore the dynamic igraph package in R, which is an open source used to create, analyse and visualise networks and graph routines. Networks and graphs are a key component when modeling relationships and interactions of complex systems/structures. Whether you are working in socal, commmuntication or biological fields igraph is useful to help understand individual connections. Well will focus on using igraph to visualise biological networks specifically ecological food webs. As food webs represent the feeding relationships within an environment where different species are conectted by predator prey interactions. 

Before we dive in to igraph lets define sone key concepts: 
- A vertex (node) is an indiviual element of the network(graph) e.g. species
- An link (edge) is the connection between two vertices showing a relationship e.g. predator-prey relationship.
